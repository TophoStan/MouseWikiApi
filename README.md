## Description
This API should help and enable users to find more than general information about a mouse, brand, microswitch, mousepad, mousefeet etc. The system is free to use, so you can look up an item how ever many times you want!

## Installation
The api is running on a heroku server https://mousewikiapi.herokuapp.com/api/. But if you want to run it locally you can use XAMPP and it should work instantly! But you will need to have run the .sql script in the root of the folder. Deploying this code on your own server should not be any different but the DOTENV variables should be changed!

## Usage
The api should be used to help your needs to find information about mice! The API works with HTTP requests. Currently only GET requests are supported, but more will come! Detailled documentation can be found on my swagger doc https://mousewikiapi.herokuapp.com/api-docs/.

##  Support
If there are any issues, bugs or crashes, you can inform me on discord: stanley#1477. Discord is used troughout the day so I should be able to respond quickly!

##  Project status
The current state of the project is unfinished. 
What will be implemented is that which is in the specified document.
